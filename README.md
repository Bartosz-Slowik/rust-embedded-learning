# rust-embedded-learning

## Recommended learning path
### 1. Begin with Rust Basics
* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Introductory book to Rust.
* [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Exercises.

It is recommended to complete corresponding exercises after each chapter of the book. See the [mapping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises#exercise-to-book-chapter-mapping).

### 2. Learn the basics of embedded
* [The Discovery book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/f3discovery/02-requirements/index.html) - Introductory book to embedded programming in Rust. No prior experience required.

You need to have either STM32F3DISCOVERY or Micro:bit evaluation boards. Ask your team's leader for availability.

### 3. Start working on a project
Ask you team's leader for a task or a small project to sharpen your skills.

### 4. Choose your way forward
Depending on your needs, you may want to learn things in a different order, So here is a list of great resources:
 * [The Embedded Rust book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/) - Intermediate book about embedded in Rust.
 * [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) - Rust book for experienced developers.
 * [Crust of Rust: Build Scripts and Foreign-Function Interfaces (FFI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pePqWoTnSmQ) - 2 hour video about interfacing with C code.

## Great articles
